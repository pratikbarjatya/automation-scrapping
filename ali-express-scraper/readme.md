# 3. Automation

- Users can use this process to extract the data on a daily basis, over a specific interval of time.
- You may use the accumuated data to extract insights out of it by creating dashboards.
- To simplify the data accumualtion, you can perform automation using a small server and Airflow application
- The notebook can be transformed into a python script which then can be used to create DAGs.
- These DAGs can be scheduled at specific interval of time over the server.
